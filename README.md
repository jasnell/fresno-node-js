James: some of the topics I'd like to cover at some point (I have some specific speakers in mind already for several of these)

1. Node.js Community / Foundation
2. The Node.js Module Ecosystem
3. Diversity in Technology
4. Internationalization in Node.js
5. IBM Bluemix and Cloud Foundry in general
6. Developing on Github
7. Node.js Frameworks (grunt, yeoman, etc)
8. An open topics night (have members of the meetup group get up and give short presentations on topics that interest them)
